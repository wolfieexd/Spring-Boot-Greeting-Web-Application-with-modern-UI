3. **Configuration (Automatic)**
   - Railway will use `nixpacks.toml` for build configuration
   - Java 21 will be installed automatically
   - Maven will build the project
   - The app will start on the PORT provided by Railway

4. **Environment Variables** (Optional)
   Railway automatically provides:
   - `PORT` - The port your app should listen on (already configured)
   
   No additional configuration needed!

5. **Access Your App**
   - Railway will provide a public URL
   - Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

### Build Process
Railway will:
1. Install Java 21
2. Run `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
3. Start the app with `java -jar target/greeting-app-1.0.0.jar`

### Monitoring
- View logs in Railway dashboard
